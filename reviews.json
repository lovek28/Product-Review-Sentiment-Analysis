My decision to buy this particular Chromebook was based partially on this feature. When mine arrived without a reader I double checked the ad and it clearly states/pictures the Chromebook as having a SD card reader. I don't know if I'm going to try and return it as I really like it otherwise. Not sure about the longevity of the item but my first impressions are good. The screen is just OK but nothing special. The build quality seems fine for a plastic body Chromebook but I worry long term about the hinges as with previous laptops/netbooks this is a weak point The speakers are bottom firing and tends to muffle sound a bit. The keyboard feels a little cheap but I've used much worse and for the price I'm fine with it. If it included the promised card reader I would have no problem rating it higher but this omission really bothers me. and lets down an otherwise decent machine."

THIS COMPUTER however is super fast on the internet, start up, shut down and just about everything else. Do not buy this computer if you need a lot of storage space ON the computer. Do not buy this computer if you are going to work with complicated programs. However, if you want a great little computer with LONG BATTERY LIFE, then BUY THIS COMPUTER. You can't beat the combination of Acer and Intel."
